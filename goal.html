            <p>
                I currently am working on my programming skills in Python, HTML and CSS. <br>
                As I continue studying my A-Levels I will make projects that are required of me, 
                as well as the ongoing process of an NEA (which I need to decide what it will be on). <br>
                I also hope to maybe learn how to soft modify/emulate hardware as I feel an interest to do so.

                <h5>Languages</h5>

                I am currently learning Spanish and hope I develop a fluency similar to English.
                Perhaps in the future I might be able to use this to translate any projects that I make.
                
                <h5>Video Editing</h5>

                I am learning how to edit videos for some personal projects of mine as a hobby, 
                however I think it will be a useful skill in the future,
                especially for presentation as well as perhaps also showcasing of projects.
