            <h2>About Me</h2> 
            <p>
               Online I go by d3l7, and I am a Yr 12 British and Spanish student currently taking A-Level education. 

               <h5> What subjects do you study?</h5>

               The subjects I am currently studying are Computer Science, Maths, Spanish and Geography, 
               all of which I hope to keep studying till I finish my A-Levels.

               <h5>What are your Computer Science related interests?</h5>
               
               Ever since childhood I have had an avid interst in technology and I have a major interest in video games,
               which has ultimately led to me being interested in programming and hardware related works. 
               
               <h5>How much experience do you currently have in Computer Science?</h5>

               Mostly just an ongoing secondary education, 
               which I hope flourishes into a university education and eventually a career!
